### Science offers solutions to the challenges of everyday life and helps us answer the great mysteries of mankind.  

<br>

In other words, it is one of the most importants ways  to access knowledge. And perhaps the best way to teach future scientific thinkers is by helping students verbalize what they have observed.

<br>

At Instituto Lizardi we firmly believe in the teaching of science at all levels and it has always been of fundamental importance in our curriculum.

<br>

This year we celebrate our 27th Annual Science Fair in which all sections of the school, from preschool to high school have participated.

<br>

The students, guided by their teachers, carried out observations, experiments and research that helped them get closer to the scientific knowledge and nurtured their curiosity in a joyful environment.

<br>

Congratulations to all for a great job!
