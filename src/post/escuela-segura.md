Congratulations to the Lizardi Institute for having successfully concluded the evaluation process of the Security Protocol Sanitary in the work environment, which demonstrates its commitment to promote and maintain health 
.of their workers.

<br>

We remind you that what you stated in your self-assessment may be verified by the Secretary of the
Work and Social Welfare.

<br>

In this new normal, it is very important that all companies and work centers
keep informed of the weekly Health Alert Traffic Light by region (state or municipal),
that will determine the level of health alert and define what type of companies and workplaces are
authorized to carry out their activities.
In the event that you are a supplier of an essential company, remember that if it exists in the region of the
work center a maximum level of health alert, you will only be able to carry out the activities related
directly with the essential sector.
