        Our roots
    </h2>
    <p>
      We organize a fair called, Guerrero es una Cajita. (The name comes from a song about Guerrero, that talks about the wonderful things that can be found in the state.) In the fair, students learn about the geography, culture, gastronomy, and art of our state of Guerrero. Our aim is to teach our students to love and care for our land.
