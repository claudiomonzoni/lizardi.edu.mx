          <h2>Tools</h2>
          <p>
            Our students also use technology guided by pedagogy. Technology is at the service of pedagogy and not vice versa.
</p>
<p>
    
  From the results of our diagnostic evaluations, teachers know the characteristics and intellectual abilities of each of the students and implement strategic actions to enhance their development.
